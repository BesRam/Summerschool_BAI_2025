    "- Master the `create_tool_calling_agent` function\n",
    "- Understand `AgentExecutor` for agent orchestration\n",
    "- Implement intelligent tool selection logic\n",
    "- Build a comprehensive financial analysis agent\n",
    "- Handle complex multi-step financial calculations\n",
    "- Create an interactive financial advisor system\n",
