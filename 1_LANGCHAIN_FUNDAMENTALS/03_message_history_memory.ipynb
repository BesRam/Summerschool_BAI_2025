      "Advisor: Hello! As you're just getting started with investing, it's great to see you taking this step towards building your financial future. Given your current financial situation and goals, here are a few recommendations to help you focus on first:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Emergency Fund**: Since you have a goal of building an emergency fund with a target amount of $20,000 by June 2025, I recommend prioritizing this goal. Aim to set aside a portion of your monthly income towards your emergency fund until you reach your target amount. This fund will provide you with a financial safety net in case of unexpected expenses or emergencies.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Budgeting**: Creating a detailed budget can help you track your income and expenses, allowing you to identify areas where you can save more towards your goals. Consider using budgeting tools or apps to help you manage your finances effectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Investing**: Once you have established your emergency fund and have a clear understanding of your budget, you can start exploring investment options. Given your age and financial goals, you may consider investing in a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and time horizon.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Educate Yourself**: Take the time to educate yourself about different investment options, such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and retirement accounts. Consider seeking advice from a financial advisor to help you make informed investment decisions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember, investing is a long-term journey, and it's essential to stay focused on your goals while monitoring your progress regularly. If you have any specific questions or need further guidance, feel free to ask!\n",

    "## Summary & Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You've Learned ðŸŽ“\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you've mastered the fundamentals of message history and memory in LangChain:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Manual Message History**: Creating conversation flows with `HumanMessage` and `AIMessage`\n",
    "2. **MessagesPlaceholder**: Dynamic templates that can include conversation history\n",
    "3. **Financial Goal Tracker**: A comprehensive class that tracks client profiles and conversation history\n",
    "4. **Memory Types**: Buffer memory vs. summary memory for different use cases\n",
    "5. **Persistent Context**: How to maintain context across multiple conversation turns\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts Mastered ðŸ”‘\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Message Types**: SystemMessage, HumanMessage, AIMessage\n",
    "- **Template Design**: Using MessagesPlaceholder for dynamic conversations\n",
    "- **Memory Management**: Choosing between buffer and summary memory\n",
    "- **Context Persistence**: Maintaining client information across conversations\n",
    "- **Conversation Flow**: Building natural, contextual financial advisory conversations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices for Memory-Enabled Chatbots ðŸ’¡\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Choose the Right Memory Type**\n",
    "   - Buffer Memory: Short conversations, need full context\n",
    "   - Summary Memory: Long conversations, want to save tokens\n",
    "   - Custom Memory: Specific business logic requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Structure Your Data**\n",
    "   - Keep client profiles organized\n",
    "   - Track goals and progress separately\n",
    "   - Use timestamps for tracking progress\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Design for Context**\n",
    "   - Include relevant information in system messages\n",
    "   - Use conversation history to personalize responses\n",
    "   - Reference previous discussions naturally\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Handle Memory Efficiently**\n",
    "   - Monitor conversation length\n",
    "   - Implement memory limits when needed\n",
    "   - Consider summarization for long conversations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps ðŸš€\n",
    "\n",
    "- Experiment with different memory configurations\n",
    "- Build more complex financial tracking systems\n",
    "- Integrate with databases for persistent storage\n",
    "- Add features like goal progress tracking and reminders\n",
    "\n",
    "Great work! You now have the foundation to build sophisticated conversational AI systems with memory! ðŸŽ‰"
